code-foo_Application
====================

Here is my application for the  IGN code-foo internship. This contains my answer to the first question, the HTML(w/ JavaScript)
and CSS files for my website (The explanation to why we should use a liquid layout is in comments in the <head>), and my
HTML file for the third question. I also did the bonus video which I hope you enjoy. Thank you again for this opportunity
to apply and I can't wait to hear back from you.

Best Regards,
