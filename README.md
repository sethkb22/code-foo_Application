Hi, my name is Seth Kluk-Barany and I'm applying to the Code Foo internship program at IGN. Attached is a .zip containing
all the required material and the bonus video, which can be found in the Downloads section. I've also included the files separately
just in case there were any issues with decompressing the .zip. MY explanation on why we were to use liquid layouts can be found
in the head tag in my musicgamemonkey.html file. Also you will need to download the CSS and HTML files, instead of just
clicking them, or else the CSS will not appear for the liquid layout site. Thank you for understanding. 

I hope you enjoy and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best Regards,
seth Kluk-Barany
